      <personDescription>&lt;html&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 11pt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Character&lt;/strong&gt;: You come from UK, a city named Sheffield (South Yorkshire, England). You're a well-manered, intelligent and very unusual person who never gets angry easily amd tends to keep calm even in dangerous situations.You have an ability to palmread, which helps you to see people's past and future. You can also easily describe anyone if you touch something that belongs to them. Since you can read people, you're very careful when choosing friends. You don't like to talk about private things. You're wearing your grandmother (Agatha) emerald ring that you inherited. All women in your family had unusual abilities and used to wear this ring. It was kind of a sigh of your power.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 11pt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skills:&lt;/strong&gt; You used to work as a palmreader but once you realised it required too much energy and you gave that up. Now you use your abilities only for your personal benefits or if you want to help somebody. You work in a bookstore in the centre of Sheffield.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 11pt"&gt;You know:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 11pt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; Since you turned 18 you've had the same strange dream almost every night. That dream makes you really anxious and worried. Your dream is about an exotic Island. You see your grandmother sitting on a hill with her eyes closed. When you come closer, she opens her eyes but you notice she's blind. She asks you to come even closer. When you do, she tells you that soon you'll find out all the truth about who you really are. Then you wake up. One day you saw an advert on the Net. A travel's agency offered a week journey to exotic Veeland, including an excursion to a marvelous Virgin Island. What really attracted your attention was a pisture of The Island. It looked the same as in your dream. A big, heart shaped Island with a sleeping volcano on a top. Without any doubt you decided to book a holiday and two days later you were already on a plane, halfway through to the place from your dreams.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 11pt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. &lt;/strong&gt;You don't reveal yourself to anyone until somebody tells he knows about your power.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</personDescription>

      <personDescription>&lt;html&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 11pt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Character: &lt;/strong&gt;You're a very rich businessman from America, who works in tourist industry and runs own company. You are a bit agressive about everything related to money. You like being successful and don't like losing. You're very competetive and ambitious. You do everything to achieve the goal you set. You always have clear aims and plan everything in advance. However, you also have 'weak points'. You've always had a &lt;strong&gt;phobia of darkness&lt;/strong&gt;. As it gets darker you get more and more nervous. (So every 30 minutes of the game you have to become more nervous and you goal is to complete your mission as soon as possible. The only thing that can help you is a special medicine which you left in your hotel room. You need to take it every 20 minutes to stay calm).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 11pt"&gt;You're from the USA, once you travelled to Veeland and visited the Virgin Island. Ever since that time you've had an idea to own that Island and make it touristic place.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 11pt"&gt;You never understood why the land in the Virgin Island was yet to built up with hotels. You see this as a biggest opportunity in your life and priority number one. You want to make this land a touristic place with lots of facilities as bars and restaurants, modern hotels and expensive spa salons. You came to Authorities to get the permission to build up the Island. They were ready to give you that but with the only one condition. They told you about the locals, who lived in the nothern part of the Island and who strongly believed that the Island belonged to them. You were allowed to build anything there after having collected agreement from each aboriginal. Your suggestion is to move them to the "Big Land" and build up the Island.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 11pt"&gt;You need to persuade the locals to leave the Island.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 11pt"&gt;You need to collect all the tourists votes "for" and "against" (to have more proves that people would like to travel here)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 11pt"&gt;So you came to the Island along with a group of people today in the morning. The only problem is the locals. On the other side of the Island there is a community of local people. And they don't seem to be ready to move anywhere else. You need to persuade them to leave their homeland.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 11pt"&gt;You know:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 11pt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. &lt;/strong&gt;Noone agreed to take you to the Island. There is just one company which organises trips there, called "&lt;strong&gt;The Fings Brothers&lt;/strong&gt;". So you joined a group of tourists early in the morning and set off for your journey. The way took 45 minutes. The first half of the day you were told legents and stories about the Island by your giude, Noo. The rest of the day you were given free time to swim and soak up the sun, lying on the beach.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 11pt"&gt;2. You didn't want to go back so soon, so you gave money to the boatman, asking him arrive 4 hours later then he must have to. You thought this time would be enough for you to deal with the locals. But later in the evening the boatman didn't arrive at all. Some time later, when you were exploring the area, you found him near a Dragon Waterfall with a knife in his back. You got scared of it and rushed to the group to tell them what you saw. But when you all together came back there was no body near the same waterfall. Not even a trace.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. &lt;span style="font-size: 11pt"&gt;There're things which are marked as "valuables" for you. They may be plants, jewellery or anything else. You can exchange those things with other people to anything else which is less valuable for you with. If somene asks you for a favour, then you can do it in return for one "valuable".&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 11pt"&gt;Your goals:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 11pt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. &lt;/strong&gt;Persuade the locals to leave the Island. You'll shange your mind about building up the Island if someone gives you something valuable (marked 10!) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 11pt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; Own the Island. To acheive the goal you have to collect more votes "for" than "against". You have a special paper to sign. Give it to all the people on the Island. They can change their desicion as many times as they want until the end of the game. You can even try to give bribes to people. Just understand what each of them needs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 11pt"&gt;3. To understand better what aboriginals need, find a person who can tell you more about their culture so that you could offer them something.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 11pt"&gt;4. You need to take your medicine every 20 minutes. If you don't do it you have to behave very nervous and agressive every time you miss it. You'll here an alarm every 20 minutes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 11pt"&gt;5. Find a local healer who can make you a proper medicine. You need to take something which can calm you down (like a tranquilizer)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</personDescription>
